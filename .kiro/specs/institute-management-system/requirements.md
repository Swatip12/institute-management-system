# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Institute Management System is a Spring Boot backend application that provides REST API endpoints for managing educational institute data including courses, students, and messages. The system serves as the backend for an administrative interface that allows CRUD operations on courses and read-only access to student and message data.

## Glossary

- **Institute Management System**: The Spring Boot backend application providing REST APIs for institute administration
- **Admin Interface**: The frontend application that consumes the REST APIs (running on localhost:4200)
- **Course Entity**: A data model representing educational courses offered by the institute
- **Student Entity**: A data model representing students enrolled in the institute
- **Message Entity**: A data model representing messages or communications within the system
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database used for data persistence during development
- **Spring Data JPA**: The data access framework used for database operations
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration to allow frontend access

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an institute administrator, I want to manage course information through REST APIs, so that I can maintain an up-to-date catalog of available courses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/courses` that returns all courses
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a POST endpoint at `/admin/courses` that creates new courses
3. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/courses/{id}` that returns a specific course by ID
4. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a PUT endpoint at `/admin/courses/{id}` that updates an existing course
5. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a DELETE endpoint at `/admin/courses/{id}` that removes a course

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an institute administrator, I want to view student information through REST APIs, so that I can access student data for administrative purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/students` that returns all students
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/students/{id}` that returns a specific student by ID

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an institute administrator, I want to view messages through REST APIs, so that I can monitor communications within the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/messages` that returns all messages
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a GET endpoint at `/admin/messages/{id}` that returns a specific message by ID

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the backend to support CORS for localhost:4200, so that the admin interface can successfully make API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL allow CORS requests from `http://localhost:4200`
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL accept preflight OPTIONS requests for cross-origin access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use proper data models with JPA annotations, so that data persistence works correctly with the H2 database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL define a Course entity with id, name, and description fields
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL define a Student entity with id, name, and email fields  
3. THE Institute Management System SHALL define a Message entity with id, senderName, email, and content fields
4. THE Institute Management System SHALL use JPA annotations for entity mapping and primary key generation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use Spring Data JPA repositories, so that database operations are handled efficiently with minimal boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a CourseRepository interface extending JpaRepository
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a StudentRepository interface extending JpaRepository
3. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide a MessageRepository interface extending JpaRepository

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a service layer, so that business logic is properly separated from controller logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide an AdminService class with methods for course management operations
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide methods in AdminService for retrieving student data
3. THE Institute Management System SHALL provide methods in AdminService for retrieving message data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to run on port 8080 with H2 database configuration, so that it can be easily deployed and tested in a development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Institute Management System SHALL run on port 8080 by default
2. THE Institute Management System SHALL use H2 in-memory database for data storage
3. THE Institute Management System SHALL include proper H2 configuration in application.properties
